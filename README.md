# Effects of Covid 19 stringency measures on air quality in Switzerland  
  
In this work, we aimed to explore if the introduction of stringency measures in Switzerland 
during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to a reduction of PM2.5 concentrations in the air. 
To do so, we created a simplified linear model using python 3.8 for the prediction of 
the monthly sum of PM2.5, based on location and precipitations. The model was validated 
using the data collected before any stringency measures (due to corona) were initiated in 
Switzerland (2016-2019). A prediction of the PM2.5 concentration in air for the years 2020-
2021 was then performed, based on the model.
  
Tools: python, QGIS and phothshop.
